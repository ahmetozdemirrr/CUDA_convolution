# Performance Analysis Report



## Introduction

This report presents the results and analysis of the CUDA convolution program implemented with two memory management techniques: **Global Memory** and **Shared Memory**. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of these implementations (Q1 and Q2) under varying conditions, including different grid shapes, block sizes, and image dimensions. The experiments involved timing the execution for each configuration, generating performance graphs, and visualizing the input and output images for selected cases.



## Experimental Setup

### Parameters

- Input Images:
  - `360x360.png`
  - `720x720.png`
  - `1200x1200.png`
- **Block Sizes:** 16, 32, 64
- Grid Shapes:
  - 10x10 (Square)
  - 20x10 (Rectangular)
  - 15x30 (Vertical Rectangular)
  - 40x40 (Large Square)
- **Repetitions:** Each test was executed multiple times, and the average execution time was recorded.

### Execution Environment

- CUDA-enabled GPU
- The shared memory limit was queried using the CUDA runtime API to ensure configurations did not exceed the hardware limitations.



## Results and Observations

### Input and Output Images

Selected input images and their processed outputs are included for visualization. These demonstrate the edge detection operation performed by the convolution program using a predefined kernel.



### Performance Graphs

Graphs were plotted for each image size, block size, and grid shape. Additionally, an average performance graph was generated to provide an overview of the execution times across all configurations.

#### Observations:

1. **Global vs. Shared Memory:**

   - For smaller images (`360x360`), **Global Memory** slightly outperformed **Shared Memory** on average, demonstrating marginally lower execution times.
   - For larger images (`1200x1200`), **Shared Memory** showed better average performance, particularly in configurations with smaller block sizes, due to more efficient memory usage.

2. **Impact of Block Sizes:**

   - Increasing block sizes generally reduced the execution time, as larger blocks allow for better utilization of the GPU's computational resources. However, diminishing returns were observed beyond a block size of 32, particularly for smaller images.

3. **Grid Shapes:**

   - Square grids (e.g., 10x10, 40x40) exhibited better performance consistency compared to rectangular grids (e.g., 15x30, 20x10), likely due to more balanced thread allocation.

4. **Shared Memory Limitations:**

   - Configurations exceeding the available shared memory size led to increased execution times, as indicated in the graphs. This was particularly evident for the `1200x1200` image with block size 64.

### Key Findings:

1. **Consistency Across Sizes:** Shared memory performed well for medium configurations but was slightly slower for smaller images on average.
2. **Memory Access Patterns:** Shared memoryâ€™s performance advantage is closely tied to optimized memory access patterns. The overhead introduced by shared memory management becomes significant when limits are exceeded.

## Conclusion

This study highlighted the trade-offs between **Global Memory** and **Shared Memory** implementations. While shared memory can yield significant performance improvements for medium-sized workloads, its benefits diminish for smaller workloads due to marginal latency differences. Careful tuning of grid and block dimensions is crucial for leveraging the advantages of shared memory effectively.
